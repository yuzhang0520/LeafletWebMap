# Leaflet Web Map Project

## Instructions

1. **Run index.html**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Viewing the Web Map**: Upon opening `index.html`, the web browser will display a map interface powered by Leaflet.
3. **Using the Control Panel**: On the left side of the map, you'll find a control panel with several options:
    - **Zoom In and Out**: Use the controls to zoom in and out of the map view.
    - **Drawing Shapes**: Choose from options to draw various shapes on the map, including lines, polygons, rectangles, circles, markers, or circle markers. After creating a shape, you can add text to its popup window. The text is editable. Click the textarea to modify the content.
    - **Editing Shapes**: Edit the properties or geometry of existing shapes on the map.
    - **Deleting Shapes**: Remove shapes from the map.
    - **Searching Text**: Utilize the search functionality to find shapes based on the text stored in their popup windows.

By following these steps, users can interact with the web map interface, create and manipulate shapes, add text annotations, and perform searches based on the stored text within the shapes' popup windows.
